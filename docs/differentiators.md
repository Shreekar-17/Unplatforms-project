# Standout touches
- Conflict bar with “reload latest + reapply” one-click.
- Column summaries: counts + priority mix; live-updated after each mutation.
- Activity timeline badges per type; lazy pagination for long histories.
- “Why this rank?” tooltip explaining comparator fields for a task in queue view.
- Empty states with quick-create templates.
- Observability: request IDs + structured logs (todo).
- Tests: version conflict, ordering, activity sequencing, queue order, basic UI drag/drop + optimistic rollback (todo).
